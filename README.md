InquisitR, an R package designed to simplify the initial phases of data exploration while enhancing the visual appeal of graphs. Currently, it offers three essential functions and I am actively developing a fourth to streamline data type conversions:

correlationR: This function creates customizable pairwise plot matrices using GGally, allowing you to tailor plots for upper triangles, lower triangles, and diagonal views.

boxplotR: Generate detailed boxplots for various combinations of factor and numeric variables within your dataset.

distributionR: Easily visualize distributions of both numeric and categorical variables, with flexible options to suit your analysis needs.

convertR: Coming soon! This function will automate data type conversions based on the characteristics of your data.
